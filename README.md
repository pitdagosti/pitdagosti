# 👋 Welcome!

Welcome to my GitHub profile — make yourself at home and grab a cup of tea ☕

I'm Pietro, a Mechatronics Engineer and Ph.D. student passionate about robotics, AI, and embedded systems.  
Below you'll find some of the projects I've worked on, from concept to execution, including system design, visuals, and development.

## 🎓 PhD Projects
### 🌡️ **LSTM Temperature Prediction**  
A PhD project implementing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, converted to TensorFlow Lite, to predict future temperature values in real-time via TCP connection. Developed in collaboration with AROL Closure Systems, the model uses past temperature data in a sliding window to generate accurate forecasts, optimized for edge devices.  
**Role:** Researcher & Developer. Designed the model architecture, implemented the inference pipeline, and evaluated prediction performance.

### ⚡ Hybrid Vibration-Based Anomaly Detection System

This project introduces a hybrid, data-driven framework for vibration-based anomaly detection in industrial capping machinery. Developed in collaboration with AROL Closure Systems, the system combines signal processing, statistical analysis, and deep learning to detect both temporal and punctual anomalies under real production conditions.  
**Role:** Researcher & Developer — designed the anomaly detection pipeline, implemented signal processing techniques, developed deep learning models (LSTM, Autoencoder), and evaluated system performance across multiple fault scenarios.

## 🔧 Fun Projects

### 👨‍🏫 **AGERE** – Technical Interview Performance Simulator

A platform that replicates a realistic technical job interview and gives you an objective performance score: reasoning quality, correctness, robustness, and response time.
Its purpose is simple: eliminate the illusion of “feeling prepared” and show you how you would actually perform.  
**Role:** Project manager, Artificial Intelligent Engineer, Developer, CMO

### 🐶 **FREISA-GPT** – Voice-Enabled Robotic Assistant
An evolution of FREISA, developed for the OpenAI Open Model Hackathon. FREISA GPT is a robotic puppy powered by gpt-oss-20b, capable of listening to voice commands, generating responses, and acting accordingly. It can perform physical actions through ROS (e.g., moving, rotating) and express emotions via a state manager controlling faces and sounds.  
**Role**: Project Manager, CMO. I curated visuals, documentation, and worked on the architecture definition.
