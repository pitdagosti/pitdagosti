# 👋 Welcome!

Welcome to my GitHub profile — make yourself at home and grab a cup of tea ☕

I'm Pietro, a Mechatronics Engineer and Ph.D. student passionate about robotics, AI, and embedded systems.  
Below you'll find some of the projects I've worked on, from concept to execution, including system design, visuals, and development.

## 🔧 Projects

### 🐾 **FREISA** – *Four-legged Robot Ensuring Intelligent Sprinkler Automation*  
A quadruped robot designed for autonomous irrigation in smart agriculture.  
**Role:** Project Manager, CMO. I created system models using SysML and handled all visuals (videos, images, logos). Helped in the development of the computer vision algorithm using RoBoFlow. I was also in charge of the
relationship with Seeed Studio and the collaboration we had.

### 🐶 **FREISA-GPT** – Voice-Enabled Robotic Assistant
An evolution of FREISA, developed for the OpenAI Open Model Hackathon. FREISA GPT is a robotic puppy powered by gpt-oss-20b, capable of listening to voice commands, generating responses, and acting accordingly. It can perform physical actions through ROS (e.g., moving, rotating) and express emotions via a state manager controlling faces and sounds.  
**Role**: Project Manager, CMO. I curated visuals, documentation, and worked on the architecture definition.
